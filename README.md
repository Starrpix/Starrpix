## Hello there! üëã

I'm [Starrpix](https://github.com/Starrpix)
With some breeze learning through Blockchain Fundamentals , along with Ethereum. I am starting to focus on Smart Contracts. 
There will be occasional JS to explore more on react , nodejs and such but the main focus will remain on Blockchain domain.
